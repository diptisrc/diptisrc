This is FacebookScraper gui screenshots. and output files of it. 

I Tried Using the other modules available for data extraction from Facebook sites. but I couldn't use it for given the task properly so, I created CustomFacebookScraper from scratch 
which can extract data from Facebook. it can find the given profile count (if the profile count is not provided then the result count). 
I ran it for 200 profiles. this scraper identified a total of 44 unique profiles and scraped the unique profiles and successfully scraped the requested data.
